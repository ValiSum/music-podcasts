        "There are few artists pushing the boundaries of their respective genres like Maryland rapper Rico Nasty and German-Iraqi electronic producer Boys Noize. The two have run in the same circles for over half a decade, but their joint collaboration has reached an apex with their three song EP, HARDC0RE DR3AMZ, a dance-floor ready project that owes as much to Berlin techno as it does to Dutch gabber music. Rico and Boys Noize – a.k.a. Alexander Ridha – are also incredible friends with a lot of love for one another, and for producer Reanna Cruz, all of these reasons make the duo’s EP one of the best projects of the year.\n\nOn the heels of Berlin techno being added to the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage for Germany, Reanna sat down with Rico and Alex for this episode of Switched on Pop.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        'Joe Keery is best known for his acting roles, such as the reformed jock Steve Harrington in "Stranger Things" and his chilling performance in season 5 of "Fargo." But he\'s also a spectacular musician. Rising through the Chicago music scene in college, he has self-released two albums under the moniker \'Djo.\' His latest work, "Decide" from 2022, serves as a coming-of-age story and a meditation on navigating modern life. Despite strong initial reviews, the album only gained widespread attention two years later when its breakout hit "End of Beginning" became a soundtrack for youthful nostalgia on TikTok, casting Keery as an accidental pop star. Joe Keery joined "Switched On Pop" to discuss the creation and significance of "Decide."\n\nSign up for the Switched On Pop Newsletter\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        "Hip-hop is in a weird place right now. Research says that the genre, in both streaming and chart performance, has declined over the last decade. And while rap artists can still get number one songs on the Hot 100, it’s a far cry from the peak of trap circa 2017, when Nielsen data named hip-hop as the most popular genre in the U.S.\nSo what does that mean for the future of rap? To find out, producer Reanna Cruz spent all weekend reporting from Inglewood, CA, at the California edition of the world’s largest hip-hop festival: Rolling Loud. Through talking to attendees and catching the weekend’s hottest sets, they learned about the current state of hip-hop – the good and the bad – as well as what the future may hold.\nTo read Reanna’s highs and lows from the festival, check out their Vulture article here. \n\nSpecial thanks to Antonio Cruz for his production help on this episode.\n\nSongs Discussed:\n\nOsamaSon – Pop\n\nNicki Minaj – BARBIE DANGEROUS\n\n¥$, Kanye West, & Ty Dolla $ign – EVERYBODY (live)\n\n¥$, Kanye West, & Ty Dolla $ign – BACK TO ME (live)\n\nJunior H – Y LLORO\n\nNatanael Cano – Pacas de Billetes\n\nFuerza Regida – Enculado\n\nThat Mexican OT, Lefty SM – Barrio (with Lefty SM)\n\nThat Mexican OT – Cowboy Killer (live)\n\nKenTheMan – Not My N**** – Extended\n\nKenTheMan – Poppin Sh!t\n\nKenTheMan – Keep Going (live)\n\nKaliii – Area Codes\n\nAction Bronson & Statik Selektah – Respect the Moustache\n\nDrake, SZA, & Sexyy Red – Rich Baby Daddy (live)\n\nSexyy Red, Sukihana – Born By the River (feat.

        "What do Duke Ellington, United Airlines, and the K Pop group Red Velvet share in common? They've all covered George Gershwin's piano concerto, Rhapsody in Blue. First premiered in 1924, the piece became an immediate hit for the way it blended American jazz with the European symphonic tradition. Gershwin had a number of successes as a composer in his day—his aria \"Summertime\" from the opera Porgy and Bess is by some measures the most covered song ever—but the staying power of the Rhapsody make it a rare instrumental piece that's instantly familiar. Maybe too familiar.\nIn 2024, there will be many centennial performances of this iconic piece, but pianist Lara Downes wanted to do something more than just the sound the notes of Gershwin's score for the umpteenth time. Downes commissioned Puerto Rican musician Edmar Colon to create a new version of Gershwin's composition, one that brought in the full spectrum of American life in 1924: fiery improvisation, Latin percussion, and dance rhythms. The resultant piece both pays tribute to an American icon while adding a new set of modern counterpoint.\nNate sat down with Lara to ask her if she was nervous to rewrite such a canonic piece, why a concerto is like a musical kaleidoscope, and the surprising family connection to Gershwin's musical world she discovered while researching Rhapsody in Blue.\n\nSongs Discussed\nGeorge Gershwin, Lara Downes, Edmar Colon - Rhapsody in Blue Reimagined\nGershwin - Rhapsody in Blue\nGershwin - 3 Preludes: II.

        "In a landscape where the music industry seems designed to stifle creativity and independence, Amelia Meath stands as a beacon of resistance. Through her involvement in bands like Sylvan Esso, Mountain Man, and The A's, and as a founder of label Psychic Hotline, Meath defies the narratives that label success in music. This conversation dives into the systemic challenges musicians face today—from the pitfalls of streaming economics to the trials of touring and beyond.
